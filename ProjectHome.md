SVN Time-Lapse View is a cross-platform viewer that downloads all revisions of a file and lets you scroll through them by dragging a slider. As you scroll, you are shown a visual diff of the current revision and the previous revision. Thus you can  see how a file evolved, and you can easily find the revision at which lines appeared, disappeared, or changed.

Time-Lapse View is a powerful visual alternative to the Subversion "blame" command. It is inspired by the excellent Time-Lapse View in the Perforce version-control system.

SVN Time-Lapse View runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and any platform that runs Java.

Kim Tiedemann is joining the project. He has a couple of Google Code projects of his own, and has already given valuable assistance with a couple of issues on this project. Kim will be fixing issues (including allowing the user to select an encoding) and supplying a repository browser.

Version 1.5:
> - Fixed [Issue 13](https://code.google.com/p/svn-time-lapse-view/issues/detail?id=13): "java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException"

Version 1.4:
> - Fixed [Issue 11](https://code.google.com/p/svn-time-lapse-view/issues/detail?id=11): "Start revision from the latest"

Version 1.3 adds a "Show Differences Only" checkbox. This hides lines that are identical. It makes it easier to see changes; it also makes browsing faster. Thanks to Barry Hunter for the [suggestion](http://code.google.com/p/svn-time-lapse-view/issues/detail?id=8&can=1).
